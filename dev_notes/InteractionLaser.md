The interaction laser should be able to know if it's interacting with nothing, GUI3D, Interactable, or a grabbable.

The laser should also be displayed with a curved line that shows the stabalized/smoothed hit point, that smoothed out hit point being the point used to interact with GUI, and other interactables.

If the laser is interacting with a grabbable object, it should tell the grabber for that hand what's being grabbed.
