Project name: _Metaphysical_
Project platform: _OpenXR (no "pancake land" support)_

## Idea

The idea of this project is to bring what Gmod, and Roblox allow, but in XR. You will be able to build out massive interctive worlds, dream games, or just create general purpose social environments, all while in VR; no desktop editor, no time spend away form the headset, and no need to put on and take of your headset while developing an avatar, environment, or game.

This project is ment to take all the good things from VRChat, and Neos, then bring them into a more streamlined, and user friendly platform that acts as the _true_ metaverse.
