*And virtual keys*

---

The virtual keyboard should be able to show up when ever a `TextEdit` GUI is focused. This should be able to be done dynamicly since we are talking about a 'metaverse' that allows for 'in-verse' level and script editing.

For right now, we can only focus on a single keyboard, and not allowing custom keyboards _(unless users decide to build a custom & compatable version of the app with custom `local_space` objects/GUI.)_ just for simplicity sake.
