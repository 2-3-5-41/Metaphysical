Grabbable objects should be manipulatable in 3D space uwing the grabbing hand's thumbstick, this should also tell our locomotion to switch from ambidextrious to opposing based on what hand is holding an object.

Grabbable objects should remember which hand grabbed it first, then treat the other hand(s) that grab after as secondary interactions for scaling objects with the 'pull-apart' gesture.
